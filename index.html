<h1>I Love Baby Raccoons</h1>
<br>
<p>Baby Raccoons are the cutest animals. They sleep during the day but when they are active at night their cutness comes out.
<br>
<br>
Raccoons, aka "masked bandits" are revered for their intelligence and ingenuity. They have very nimble and manipulative paws and are very strong. These characteristics provide them with the necessary tools to damage and destroy property in their efforts to survive in urban environments. The following are some more raccoon facts and raccoon information for Vancouver homeowners:</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Habitat</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>Urban: Although the wild raccoon lives a largely solitary life, the attraction to urban areas can cause them to much more densely populate. A density of 10 - 25 raccoons per square kilometer has been observed. They will build their dens in chimneys, attics, roofs, crawl spaces, under decks and sheds.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Breeding</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>Once per year: Male raccoons will attempt to mate with multiple partners each season whereas the female will mate with only one male, avoiding all others afterwards. Mating occurs during the winter months but can continue until June. This prolonged mating season makes it essential for wildlife technicians to detect if there are any babies present during the initial assessment. Offspring are born about 9 weeks after mating. It is not uncommon for mothers to make a last minute den to give birth in which is why urban structures are so attractive.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Litter size</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>The gestation period is around 63 days. Female raccoons produce litters between 1 and 7 offspring (typically 3 or 4).
